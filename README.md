This repository contains a game designed for outreach activities in which we want to illustrate how habitat preferences by animals affect their movement trajectories, and hence, their distribution across the landscape. 
The model is designed in Netlogo language, to use it you need to download Netlogo (free software, to download https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/download.shtml). 
The game, its code code and explanations are in the .nlogo file. There is an additional pdf file in Spanish where it is explained how to play. If anyone has problems with the translation please contact me to tmoranlopez@gmail.co
I will upload as soon as possible a version of the pdf in English.
